        Reset all game state for the next round while preserving player bankrolls.
        
        Prepares the game for a new round by resetting hands, game state,
        and betting information while maintaining player bankrolls and
        overall game progression. Handles bankruptcy by excluding bankrupt
        players from the new round.
        
        Reset Process:
        1. Reset player hands and bust status (non-bankrupt players only)
        2. Deal new 2-card hands to active players
        3. Reset dealer with new 2-card hand
        4. Clear betting round data (pot, individual bets)
        5. Reset game state to betting phase
        6. Update active player count
        
        Preservation:
        - Player bankrolls maintained from previous round
        - Player names and identities preserved
        - Game round counter continues incrementing
        - Overall game statistics maintained
        
        Exclusions:
        - Bankrupt players remain bankrupt (no reset)
        - Previous round betting data is cleared
        - Previous hands are discarded
