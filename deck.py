Generic Playing Card Deck Implementation

This module provides the foundation for playing card games with a standard
52-card deck. It includes the Card dataclass and a generic Deck class that
can be extended for specific games like Blackjack.

Classes:
    Card: Represents a single playing card with suit, value, and optional game-specific value
    Deck: Generic deck of 52 playing cards with shuffle, draw, and discard functionality

The design allows for extension to game-specific decks (like BlackjackDeck) while
maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
